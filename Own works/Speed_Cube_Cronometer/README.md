FUNCTION
 Simulate the speed cuberÂ´s timer. When you press the button you have 10 seconds to study the cube, then the green LED turns off and the red LED turns on. The cube is placed near the sensor and the timer starts counting when the distance increases (when the cube is picked up). When the cube is solved and returned to its original position, the display shows the last time and the best one.
